# Problem Framing Document: Recruit-AI

## 1. The Persona: "Sarah"
**Role:** Talent Acquisition Manager / Founder
**Company:** Tech Company (50-100 employees)
**Context:** Sarah is a one-person recruiting team or has very limited support. She wears multiple hats—sourcing, screening, scheduling, and onboarding.
**Goals:** Hire top talent quickly, ensure a great candidate experience, and reduce administrative overhead.
**Frustrations:**
- "Buried in PDFs": Spending hours manually reviewing resumes.
- Decision Fatigue: Fear of rejecting good candidates due to speed.
- "Ghosting": Losing candidates because she can't reply fast enough.
- Calendar Tetris: Endless back-and-forth emails to schedule interviews.

## 2. The Problem Statement
**"High-volume screening leads to decision fatigue, slow time-to-hire, and poor candidate experience."**

Small to mid-sized companies receive hundreds of resumes for open roles but lack the dedicated HR staff to screen them effectively. This bottleneck results in:
1.  **Inefficiency:** 60% of a recruiter's time is spent on screening and scheduling.
2.  **Bias & Error:** Fatigue leads to inconsistent evaluation.
3.  **Talent Loss:** Top candidates are off the market within 10 days; slow processes mean missing out.

## 3. Market Research Summary
**Market Opportunity:**
- The HR Tech market for SMBs is projected to grow at a **CAGR of 13.5%**, driven by the need for automation.
- **80% of SMBs** are increasing their investment in HR software in 2024-2025.
- **Automation is a priority:** 17% of HR teams have identified automating manual processes as a top focus for the next 12 months.

**Competitive Landscape:**
- **Enterprise Players:** Paradox (Olivia), Ashby. These are powerful but often expensive and complex for a 50-person company.
- **SMB Players:** Breezy HR, JazzHR. Good ATS features but often lack "Agentic" intelligence (reasoning + action).
- **The Gap:** A lightweight, "Agent-first" solution that doesn't just *track* applicants (ATS) but *acts* like a recruiter (Screening & Scheduling) for SMBs who can't afford enterprise AI.

## 4. The Solution: Recruit-AI
An Agentic AI solution that automates the "Screening & Scheduling" phase.
- **Input:** Job Description + Resume (PDF/Text).
- **Process:** AI Agent analyzes fit, scores the candidate, and drafts the email/schedule invite.
- **Output:** A ranked list of candidates with actionable insights (Interview/Reject).
