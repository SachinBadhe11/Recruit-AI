# Recruit-AI: Sales Pitch Deck Content

## Slide 1: The Hook
**Title:** Recruit-AI: Stop Screening, Start Hiring.
**Subtitle:** The Agentic AI that gives every SMB a dedicated Recruiting Coordinator.
**Visual:** A split screen. Left side: A stressed recruiter buried in papers ("Chaos"). Right side: A calm recruiter drinking coffee while the AI works ("Control").
**Script/Notes:** "Meet Sarah. She's a founder of a 50-person tech company. She just posted a job for a Product Manager. By tomorrow, she'll have 200 emails. She's drowning in PDFs, and she's terrified she's going to miss the perfect candidate because she's too busy to read them all. This is the reality for thousands of SMBs today."

## Slide 2: Market Opportunity
**Title:** The SMB Hiring Crisis
**Key Data Points:**
- **$84B** Market: Global HR Tech market by 2032.
- **13.5% CAGR**: Growth rate for SMB HR Tech.
- **The Problem:** 60% of a recruiter's time is wasted on manual screening and scheduling.
- **Why Now?** Agentic AI has finally matured. We don't just need "better filters" (ATS); we need "autonomous agents" that can read, reason, and act.

## Slide 3: The Solution
**Title:** Meet Your New AI Recruiter
**Concept:** Recruit-AI is not just software; it's an **Agent**.
**How it Works:**
1.  **Ingest:** Upload Job Description & Resumes.
2.  **Analyze:** The Agent reads every resume like a human, comparing it against the JD criteria.
3.  **Act:** It scores candidates (0-100), writes a summary, and *automatically drafts the interview invite* for the top 10%.
**Value Prop:** "Hire 40% faster. Zero decision fatigue."

## Slide 4: The Prototype (Visuals)
**Title:** Simple, Powerful, Intelligent.
**Visuals:**
- **Dashboard:** Clean interface showing "Active Jobs" and "Candidate Pipeline".
- **Candidate Card:** A specific candidate profile showing their "Match Score" (e.g., 92/100) and a "Why?" summary generated by AI (e.g., "Strong match for Product Strategy, but lacks SQL experience").
- **Action:** A "Schedule Interview" button that triggers the agent.

## Slide 5: Tech Architecture
**Title:** Built for Intelligence & Speed
**Diagram:**
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind (Fast, Responsive UI).
- **The Brain (Agent):** n8n Workflow.
    - *Trigger:* New File Upload.
    - *Processing:* LLM Node (Gemini/GPT-4) for analysis.
    - *Output:* JSON Structure (Score, Summary).
- **Integration:** REST API connecting UI to the Agent.

## Slide 6: Roadmap & Financials
**Title:** From Tool to Platform
**6-Month Roadmap:**
- **Month 1 (MVP):** Resume Screening & Scoring.
- **Month 3:** Automated Scheduling (Calendar Integration).
- **Month 6:** Voice Agent for Phone Screening.
**Financial Projections:**
- **Year 1:** 100 Beta Users (Free/Low Cost).
- **Year 3:** $2M ARR (SaaS Model: $199/month per company).

## Slide 7: Success Metrics
**Title:** Measuring Impact
**North Star Metric:** **"Time to Interview"** (Time from application to first interview booked).
**Key KPIs:**
1.  **Screening Time:** Reduce from 10 hours/week to 10 minutes/week.
2.  **Candidate Satisfaction:** 4.8/5 stars (due to faster replies).
3.  **Placement Rate:** % of AI-recommended candidates who get hired.
